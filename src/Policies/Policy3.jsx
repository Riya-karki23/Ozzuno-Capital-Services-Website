    <div>RISK DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT (RDD) 

This is the "Scare Document." It ensures no one can sue you if they lose money. 

WARNING: SYSTEMIC VOLATILITY & CAPITAL EROSION 

Investments in Capital Markets, Unlisted Securities, and Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) are subject to Systemic Market Risks which may result in the partial or total erosion of the Principal Capital. 

CLAUSE 1: ILLIQUIDITY OF UNLISTED ASSETS 

The User acknowledges that "Unlisted" or "Pre-IPO" securities lack a centralized discovery mechanism. Liquidity is theoretically non-existent until a formal Listing Event occurs. The Firm provides no warranty regarding the timeline, valuation, or certainty of such an event. 

CLAUSE 2: NO GUARANTEE OF RETURNS 

Past performance metrics, deal tombstones, and AUA trajectories displayed on this site are historical artifacts and not predictive indicators. The Firm explicitly disclaims any guarantee of fixed returns, capital protection, or dividend consistency. 

CLAUSE 3: REGULATORY FLUX 

The valuation of assets may be materially impacted by retrospective taxation amendments, changes in SEBI regulations, or geopolitical instability. The User assumes full liability for these macro-environmental variables. </div>
