9. FEE REMITTANCE & NON-REFUNDABLE RETAINER MANDATE 

Replace "Refund Policy" with this. It ensures you never have to give money back. 

SECTION A: THE RETAINER PRINCIPLE 

All professional fees, including "Engagement Retainers," "Mobilization Advances," and "Advisory Levies," are deemed Earned Upon Receipt. These funds are allocated immediately to the deployment of human capital and intellectual resources. 

SECTION B: NO-REFUND STATUTE 

Ozzuno Capital operates under a strict "No-Refund / No-Reversal" policy. The User acknowledges that Strategic Advisory and Investment Banking services are qualitative and effort-based. The termination of a mandate by the Client, regardless of the stage of execution, does not absolve the Client of their obligation to settle all accrued fees. 

SECTION C: FORCE MAJEURE EXCEPTIONS 

No refunds shall be processed due to service interruptions caused by sovereign policy shifts, regulatory moratoriums, or systemic market halts (e.g., SEBI halting trading). The Firm’s obligation is limited to the "Best Effort" execution of the mandate.
