4. AML & CFT (ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING) CHARTER 

This implies you have police-like powers to freeze assets. 

STATUTORY MANTATE: 

Ozzuno Capital adheres strictly to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 and the guidelines issued by the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-IND). 

PROTOCOL 1: SOURCE OF FUNDS VERIFICATION 

The Firm reserves the right to demand forensic proof of the "Source of Funds" for any transaction exceeding statutory thresholds. Failure to provide such evidence will result in the immediate freezing of the engagement and the filing of a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) with the relevant authorities. 

PROTOCOL 2: POLITICALLY EXPOSED PERSONS (PEPS) 

Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) protocols are automatically triggered for Users identified as PEPs or their close associates. We reserve the right to decline mandates where the Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO) structure is opaque or domiciled in non-compliant jurisdictions (FATF Blacklist).
