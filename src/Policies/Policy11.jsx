11. DIGITAL CONDUCT & PROHIBITED USAGE DIRECTIVE 

Replace "Acceptable Use Policy" with this. It sounds like a penal code. 

DIRECTIVE I: SYSTEM INTEGRITY 

The User is strictly prohibited from deploying automated bots, spiders, or "Distributed Denial of Service" (DDoS) vectors against the Ozzuno infrastructure. Any attempt to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of our Neural Core will be interpreted as a Hostile Cyber Act under the Information Technology Act, 2000. 

DIRECTIVE II: CONTENT SANITIZATION 

Users authorized to access the "Partner Portal" or "Data Room" are prohibited from uploading files containing malicious payloads, logic bombs, or unverified executables. 

DIRECTIVE III: ZERO-TOLERANCE ENFORCEMENT 

Violation of this directive will result in the immediate Blacklisting of the User’s digital fingerprint, the forfeiture of all access privileges, and the initiation of criminal proceedings with the Cyber Crime Cell.
