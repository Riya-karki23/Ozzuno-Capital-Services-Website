10. EXTERNAL LINKAGE & THIRD-PARTY ASSOCIATION PROTOCOL 

Replace "Hyperlinking Policy" with this. It distances you from liability. 

CLAUSE 1: THE "ARM'S LENGTH" DISCLAIMER 

This domain may contain "outbound nodes" (hyperlinks) connecting to third-party regulatory bodies (SEBI, RBI), exchanges (NSE, BSE), or payment gateways. The existence of such nodes does not constitute an Endorsement, Warranty, or Fiduciary Alliance with these external entities. 

CLAUSE 2: LIABILITY FIREWALL 

Once the User traverses an outbound node, they exit the Ozzuno Secure Domain. We expressly disclaim all liability for the data hygiene, malware exposure, or privacy violations encountered on third-party infrastructure. The User proceeds at their own peril. 

CLAUSE 3: INBOUND LINKING PROHIBITION 

No third-party entity is permitted to establish a "Deep Link" or "Backlink" to this domain without the express, written consent of the Ozzuno Board of Directors. Unauthorized linking will be treated as "Cyber Trespass."
